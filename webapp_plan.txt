lets work on phase 1. draft webpage 

these are just rough ideas so feel free to add to and modify 

so the webpage should have idk 5 or 6 tabs 

home page 

weekly standings

user team rosters

free agents 

draft board / room 

how do i set up the website to have multiple pages -- what does that look like in my web_app python directory? 



| Tab                    | Purpose                                                      | Notes                                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Home**               | Welcome page, overview of league, instructions               | Optional banner / latest news                                                  |
| **Weekly Standings**   | Points per team, weekly breakdown, line chart                | Reads from `FantasyRosters + GameLog`                                          |
| **User Team Rosters**  | Shows each user’s roster + weekly points                     | Allows clicking a player → details                                             |
| **Free Agents**        | Players not on a roster, sorted by last week / season points | Enable search/filter                                                           |
| **Draft Board / Room** | Live draft interface                                         | Show all players, projections, draft buttons, “best available” recommendations |

this is the structure of my project :

./scraper and pipeline:

./web_app:
